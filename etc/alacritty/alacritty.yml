# This configuration is downloaded from the Alacritty release page and modified
# with some general defaults. Overrides specific to the host machine should be
# added to ~/.config/alacritty/override.yml

# Imports are loaded in order, skipping all missing files, with the importing
# file being loaded last. If a field is already present in a previous import, it
# will be replaced.
#
# All imports must either be absolute paths starting with `/`, or paths relative
# to the user's home directory starting with `~/`.
