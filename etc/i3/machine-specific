# This file is not linked, but copied in because I like installing/using different
# fonts on different machines.  i3 does NOT allow overriding existing config with
# its include directive, so change this locally at will.  Check myrcs for the
# original or updated values if needed.

# Font for window titles. Will also be used by the bar unless a different font
# is used in the bar {} block below.
#font pango:monospace 12

# This font is widely installed, provides lots of unicode glyphs, right-to-left
# text rendering and scalability on retina/hidpi displays (thanks to pango).
font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 12

# Fix display and use both monitors
